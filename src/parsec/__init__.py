"""Package placeholder to satisfy packaging tools.

This empty package allows Poetry/setuptools to locate a package matching the
project name `llm-structured-output-engine` (normalized to
`llm_structured_output_engine`). It is a lightweight shim and does not move
existing modules; we can later refactor to place actual package code here.
