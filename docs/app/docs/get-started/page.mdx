# Getting Started

Install the package:

```bash
pip install parsec
```

**parsec** offers different adapters for model providers. This collection of adapters will grow as the project matures.

Import the adapter for the model provider:

```python
from parsec import OpenAIAdapter
```

initialize the adapter:

```python
adapter = OpenAIAdapter(
    api_key="your-key-here",
    model="gpt-4o-mini"
)
```
