# Welcome to Parsec

**Parsec** makes it easy to get structured, reliable output from large language models.

Whether you're working with OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google's Gemini, parsec gives you a simple way to ensure the AI returns exactly the data format you need—every time.

## What is Parsec?

Parsec is a lightweight toolkit that helps you:
- Get predictable, structured responses from any major LLM provider
- Validate responses against your requirements automatically
- Fix common formatting issues without manual intervention
- Switch between AI providers without rewriting code

Think of it as a safety net for AI outputs. Instead of hoping the model returns valid JSON or the right data structure, parsec makes sure of it.

## Why Use Parsec?

**For developers building with AI:**
- 🎯 Stop fighting with inconsistent LLM outputs
- 🔄 Easily switch between OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini
- ⚡ Get started in minutes with a simple, intuitive API
- 🛡️ Validate and repair responses automatically

**For production applications:**
- 📊 Monitor token usage and performance
- 🔍 Debug issues with comprehensive logging
- ✅ Trust your AI responses are valid
- 📈 Scale confidently with async support

## Quick Peek

```python
# Define what you want
schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "age": {"type": "number"}
    }
}

# Get it from any LLM
result = await engine.enforce(
    "Extract: John is 30 years old",
    schema
)

# Use reliable, structured data
print(result.parsed_output)
# {"name": "John", "age": 30}
```

That's it. No parsing, no error handling, no hoping it works.
