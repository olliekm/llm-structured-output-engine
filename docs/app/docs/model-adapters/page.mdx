# Model Adapters

**parsec** uses a modular model provider architecture. This can and should be extended with more functionality that fits your needs.

Currently we offer the following models (More models will be added with time):
- [OpenAI](./model-adapters/openai)
- [Anthropic](./model-adapters/anthropic)
- [Gemini](./model-adapters/gemini)
